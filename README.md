# python-playground
A playground to mess around and learn python with Skye!

## 🚀 Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces

This repository is configured with a devcontainer that provides a complete Python development environment in GitHub Codespaces.

### Quick Start
1. Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
2. Select "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main" (or your current branch)
4. Wait for the environment to load (first time may take a few minutes)
5. Start coding Python! 🐍

### What's Included
- Python 3.11
- Popular development tools (pylint, flake8, black, isort)
- Data science libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter notebook support
- VS Code extensions for Python development

### Try It Out
Run the example file to test your environment:
```bash
python example.py
```

Or open the `playground.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to explore interactively!

### Installing Additional Packages
Add packages to `requirements.txt` and they'll be installed automatically when the codespace starts, or install them manually:
```bash
pip install package-name
```

Happy coding! 🎉
